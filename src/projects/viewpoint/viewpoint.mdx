  <ProjectOverview>
    IBM Global Business Services has had market success by addressing a broad range of customer problems. However the ability to cover complex end-to-end scenarios has resulted in solutions that are often made to order and can create silos between the sales and execution teams. This often leads to unmet client expectations.
    Our design team saw an opportunity to bring a human-centered point of view to a major prong of the GBS transformation effort, the Offering Development Program.

IBM Global Business Services identified that 20% of the services they provide are repeatable and address a well understood customer pain point. The rest are made to order. To grow, they decided to increase repeatable, pre-built solutions to 80% of their offerings. In order to create meaningful offerings at the scale needed, we had to focus equally on efficiency and promoting good Design habits.

Our team created a digital product that would standardize offering creation while emphasizing Design Thinking tools and practices to create human-centered outcomes. Our researchers observed sellers as they worked through developing new offerings and were able to use those learnings to shape our direction.

    How might we educate offering managers to build compelling offerings that address real user needs repeatably, and at scale?

During the research phase, our team produced a project roadmap and a detailed service blueprint. We then built a fully functional web-based interface where individuals and teams could collaborate and build offerings with a focus on understanding the market opportunity through a user- centric lens before committing to offering artifacts.
