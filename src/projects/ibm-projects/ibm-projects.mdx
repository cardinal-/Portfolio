<ProjectTitle>Complexity control</ProjectTitle>

  <ProjectOverview>
    This project was self directed. It began through a conversation I was having with a friend about Spotify. When the streaming service started I felt the complexity of the interface was overwhelming. I thought about how to address that issue with a design. Putting these ideas onto paper eventually led to me using this project as part of my application to IBM design and eventually to my first successful patent submition.

  Applications can have a lot of information in them. I work at a company that specializes in providing tools for users that need to interact with many types of data and many potential ways that they may want to see that data. In a scenario where we have many data items to filter, what if we could provide the ability to zoom in and out of that complexity and  provide a taylored view that is specific to what I want to see? The starting point for this project was a conversation about Spotify and just how overwhelming the volume of information felt.
  
  I wondered what a tailored view would look like? Could the application be smart enough to suggest the things I want to see. Sure we have suggestion engines and in some user experiences these are a fine way to help direct users. I think we are all familiar with the Amazon “people who viewed this also viewed” approach. 
   
  But one key difference that I uncovered with the Spotify example is that so much about music is about discoverability. While talking through the problems with the complexity of the catalog, I also heard that the richness in that volume of options is appealing. The difference is that element of control, or put better by the friend I was sharing coffee with:

    I don’t want to be told what I like, I want to figure it out for myself, so I know it’s real.
