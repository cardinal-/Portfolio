  <ProjectOverview>
    This project was self directed. It began through a conversation I was having with a friend about Spotify. When the streaming service started I felt the complexity of the interface was overwhelming. I thought about how to address that issue with a design. Putting these ideas onto paper eventually led to me using this project as part of my application to IBM design and eventually to my first successful patent submition.
