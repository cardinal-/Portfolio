    I love solving problems that impact real people. I fell in love with design
    thinking as a framework for what I had been pursuing for most of my life
    without knowing what it was called. To watch and learn and then use that
    understanding to solve a problem, then observe and iterate until the users
    say "this is good" is the kind of magic that I love to traffic in. I have
    been fortunate to be a part of IBM's design transformation that is
    headquartered right here in Austin, Texas. It also helps to have a good set
    of pens.
